      <!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
      <section id="about" class="section-content">
        <p>Hi, I'm Hasitha. I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science from the University of Jaffna. I am interested in opportunities where I can deploy my analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills. My wide range of academic and professional experiences allows me to bring a diverse set of skills to every task that I am held accountable. My ultimate goal is to contribute to innovations of positive change. The work is an ongoing education for me, so I am always open to meet new people, suggestions, and exciting opportunities.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working, you will find me practising martial arts and Muay Thai. In the winter, I am a novice skier. During the warmer months here in Colombo, I enjoy swimming and mountain biking. I follow several action, martial arts and comedy genre movies. I am an aspiring chef, and like to spend my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in Networking and Cyber Security.</p>
